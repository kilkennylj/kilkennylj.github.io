<ul>
<li>January 2024 - February 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was created as a part of COP 4331, Processes of Object-Oriented Programming, at UCF. It was created in a team of five, where I was the project manager and database manager. The project aimed to make a contact manager where users can register, log in, and then manage contacts by inserting, deleting, modifying, and searching. We made our website have an ocean theme, from which the name "wave" comes. This name was also a feature on the website that would allow a user to "wave" to a contact by clicking a button that prepared a default emailing template in the user's default mailing app. This project was hosted by DigitialOcean during the Spring 2024 semester.
As the project manager, I used Trello to ensure the team met the deadlines required for us to succeed. I also held meetings to ensure everyone in the team was adequately coordinating.
As the database manager, I used MySQL to set up the database, with different users who logged in and added contacts to their lists. I worked closely with the API team to ensure that their PHP scripts would work with the naming convention used in the database.
This project was created using a LAMP stack and took around one month.</p>

<li>February 2024 - May 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was created as a part of COP 4331, Processes of Object-Oriented Programming, at UCF. It was created in a team of seven, where I was the project manager, database manager, and API developer. The project aimed to use LastFM and Spotify's APIs to allow users to click on albums for collection and rating purposes. This project was available on the web and mobile using Heroku.
As the project manager, I used Jira to manage the team and ensure we knew when to finish deadlines and what pieces were critical for the project's success. I held weekly meetings where we would ensure everyone on the team was aware of progress and problems.
As the database manager, I used MongoDB to make the database for this project. This job was much more complex than the previous project because of using the LastFM API and the Spotify API. I had to clean the database to ensure there were no bogus entries, which was often the case since there were issues with LastFM's API.
As an API developer, I worked with LastFM's API and Spotify's API to make the connection between their APIs and our API seamless. This took a lot of effort, and Spotify was only implemented as a backup for when LastFM's API would fail, which was often. After many debugging trials, this API appropriately worked, and the only issue was that it had more features available than we had time to implement in the final for the class it was made for.
This project was created using a MERN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS.</p>

<ul>
<li>June 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>My honors undergraduate thesis is currently titled, "Using Deep-Learning Sequential Models and Contrastive Learning for Occupancy Prediction in Listings".
The proposal for this project was completed in August 2024, and the thesis is planned to end in the Spring 2025 semester.</p>
<p>This project's goal is to take data from insideairbnb.com and use different machine learning and deep learning models to predict different variables.
The main focus is to predict occupancy of a listing, which will allow a customer or an owner to know when a desired listing will be available.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footerContainer"><div class="contactInfo"><ul><li><img src="/images/githubLogo.png" alt="GitHub"/> <a href="https://github.com/kilkennylj/">kilkennylj</a></li><li><img src="/images/linkedInLogo.png" alt="LinkedIn"/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kilkennylj/">kilkennylj</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"finProjects":["\u003ch2 id=\"wavecontactmanager\"\u003eWave Contact Manager\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJanuary 2024 - February 2024\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was created as a part of COP 4331, Processes of Object-Oriented Programming, at UCF.
