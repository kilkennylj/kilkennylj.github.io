I have talked a little about my interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, but I will talk about what I know about it. As a second year in university, I am beginning my long journey of learning all these exciting world-changing ideas. Here, I will talk about the start of my Honors Undergraduate Thesis, my work as an assistant researcher for a finance-related machine learning project, and developments in the machine learning world that I have read about."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"First, let me explain the Honors Undergraduate Thesis (HUT) program. It is an honors program for students with at least two semesters, the first where you write a proposal and the second where you write your thesis. The program has you with a Thesis Chair and a professor who works as your mentor so you can build your thesis effectively and without significant errors. I have just started Directed Readings, the first semester of HUT, and I am currently in the reading part of it. I recently read about Contrastive Learning, which is just as interesting as I hoped. While I am focusing more on linguistics in machine learning, I found it very interesting how Contrastive Learning is used to recognize unlabeled photos by using what it already knows to try to build a baseline. I will be using Contrastive Learning at least implicitly in my project, so reading about it will make me better at my project."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Now, I will talk about the work I have already done in the machine learning world with my work as a research assistant. Our project aims to predict various things about the stock market based on social media, financial news, video content, and trends. The significance of this is in getting multi-modal data and using this to gain an advantage over other models that try to predict similar things. FinGPT is an LLM that does similar things to what we wanted to accomplish by incorporating social media data into these predictions. We found out about this model a little late, which caused us to focus on innovating more with our architecture, which we are currently trying to perfect with different experiments that will help us make our model have excellent results. Once this project is completed, it will be on the projects page, and I will make a blog post about its start, middle, and end."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"As for the developments I have made while studying machine learning, I most appreciate the help I can get as a beginner. If I were studying this without the help of recorded lectures from renowned universities, quick replies through messaging apps like Slack, and help from boards like Stack Overflow, it would be a lot harder to excel. Also, with tools like the UCF library allowing me to access computer science papers that have been published, I can get inspired easily. I aspire to be the person whoâ€™s paper helps the next student like it helped me."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Thanks for reading, and next week, I will talk about the game I am making for fun over the summer."}]}]}},"author":{"name":"Liam Kilkenny","biography":null,"id":"clwtmqok20nlv07lnay4kvy09","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/3jLmcJAIQ8GTMNVwlype"}},"slug":"post-2","date":"2024-06-09","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"ml"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
