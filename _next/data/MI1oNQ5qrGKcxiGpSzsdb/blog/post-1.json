Welcome to my blog. The website is at the beginning of development, but I wanted to start my blog early to blog about its development and how it was going. Starting the blog early will be an excellent addition to the website because you can see the past and how development was going."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"I want to talk about hygraph.com, the tool I use to create these blogs. It is very user-friendly and allows you to write what you want while it deals with the styling and format of the blogs. I will change many settings to fit my vision for my website, but it still does a lot of work for me, which is very neat."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"I also want to talk about the color design choices for this website. One of the things I focused on a lot before officially starting on the coding for this site was color. I wanted something that looked unique but also professional. Many personal portfolio websites I view stick to black and white or navy blue. I am not opposed to those colors being on my website, but I feel it’s bland, and I could work harder to find a more excellent color palette that looks professional and unique. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"I succeeded when I found the color scheme that I currently use. It was created based on a shade of purple from one of my dress shirts. Then, I used coolors.co to generate a color palette that looked nice with that color. I made sure the colors had sufficient contrast with each other by using Google Lighthouse, a Google tool that checks contrast on websites along with other things relating to accessibility. After that, I showed the color scheme to many people, asking for their thoughts. After receiving positive reviews, I kept the color scheme that you see now."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"That’s all for today. As the website grows and I encounter more challenges with development, I will talk about them here. Thanks for reading!"}]}]}},"author":{"name":"Liam Kilkenny","biography":null,"id":"clwtmqok20nlv07lnay4kvy09","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/3jLmcJAIQ8GTMNVwlype"}},"slug":"post-1","date":"2024-06-02","categories":[{"name":"Web Development","slug":"webdev"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
