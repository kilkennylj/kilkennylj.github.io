Today, I will be talking about the classes I plan on taking in the fall semester at the University of Central Florida and what I am looking forward to in those classes. I am taking four classes: two classes for my math major and two classes for my computer science major."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"My math classes are Advanced Calculus 1 and Intro to Partial Differential Equations. These problematic upper-level math courses require excellent time management and the study of their respective textbooks. While I am worried about the difficulty of these courses, I am excited to take them because the concepts they are about are fascinating to me. I plan to pass these classes by ensuring I spend the time required to understand the material and complete practice problems relating to content in the current unit. Passing these classes will help me achieve my goals because they relate to computational concepts. For example, partial differential equations are used in some aspects of machine learning and can be used for analyzing and interpreting data. Advanced Calculus is also essential since it will help me be more formal with my proofs and my mathematical writing."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"My computer science courses are Algorithms for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. These courses align with many projects I am currently doing and with my interests. These courses are top-rated at my university because of the exponentially increasing field of machine learning, which makes these courses a great place to meet many like-minded students. I have also met people who have taken these courses, and they said they help me understand some basic concepts in machine learning and using tools such as Google Collab. These courses arenâ€™t known for being as tricky as the math courses I am taking, but I will still put in the effort required to excel in these courses."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"My fall semester will be a semester of challenges and learning things I am interested in. Once it is over, I am sure I will be glad that I pushed myself far enough to take on some challenges and will be happy I tried as hard as I did."}]}]}},"author":{"name":"Liam Kilkenny","biography":null,"id":"clwtmqok20nlv07lnay4kvy09","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/3jLmcJAIQ8GTMNVwlype"}},"slug":"post-7","date":"2024-07-28","categories":[{"name":"Miscellaneous","slug":"misc"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
