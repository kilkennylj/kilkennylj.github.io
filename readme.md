Hey I'm Liam Kilkenny and here's my own personal portfolio website.

I created this as a personal project over the summer of 2024.
Here are some of the resources I used to create this webpage:
 - For my color palette: https://coolors.co/f8f1ff-b9aeff-00a4d6-03002e
 - For color contrast checking: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
 - For accessibility: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview
