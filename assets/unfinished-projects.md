## Honors Undergraduate Thesis
- June 2024

My honors undergraduate thesis is currently titled, "Using Deep-Learning Sequential Models and Contrastive Learning for Occupancy Prediction in Listings".
The proposal for this project was completed in August 2024, and the thesis is planned to end in the Spring 2025 semester.

This project's goal is to take data from insideairbnb.com and use different machine learning and deep learning models to predict different variables.
The main focus is to predict occupancy of a listing, which will allow a customer or an owner to know when a desired listing will be available.
