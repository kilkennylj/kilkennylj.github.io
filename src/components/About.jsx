                    Hello, I am Liam Kilkenny, and this is my personal portfolio website.
                    I am in my 3rd year at UCF, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
                    I plan on graduating in Spring 2026.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took a particular interest in Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning in my 2nd year, where I started to work with professors in the Artifical Intelligence Initive.
                    This interest has stuck with me and is the focus of my Honors Undergraduate Thesis project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy working on projects and helping peers with computer-related problems in my free time.
                    I like to help others with their computer-related problems since many want to do modern projects, but they often require some knowledge of coding.
                    I like to act as a teacher so they can learn quickly and comfortably, showing results.
                </p>
