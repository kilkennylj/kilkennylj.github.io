I am in my 3rd year at UCF, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I plan on graduating in Spring 2026.</p><p>I took a particular interest in Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning in my 2nd year, where I started to work with professors in the Artifical Intelligence Initive. This interest has stuck with me and is the focus of my Honors Undergraduate Thesis project.</p><p>I enjoy working on projects and helping peers with computer-related problems in my free time. I like to help others with their computer-related problems since many want to do modern projects, but they often require some knowledge of coding. I like to act as a teacher so they can learn quickly and comfortably, showing results.</p></div></div><div class="homeContent"><h1 style="display:block;text-align:center">Welcome</h1><p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! On this website, I want to show you my goals and how I am accomplishing them on the Projects page, what I have done with my resume on the Resume page, and what my thoughts are about what I am learning on the Blog page.</p><p>I created the projects page to discuss each project and the obstacles I overcame while making them. This page includes projects I created as part of a school project, like Turntable, and personal projects I have developed, like this website. The projects page also has projects I am currently working on, and as I get along with them, I will post progress pictures of how they are going.</p><p>The resume page is simple, but I will introduce it to stay consistent. The page displays my up-to-date resume in a large viewport so you can read it without downloading. And, of course, you can download my resume to have a copy.</p><p>The blog page has the most unique design of all of the pages. I implemented hygraph and graphql to make it work. It has blog posts from the beginning of development, making it an excellent website history and a perspective into my present ideas and challenges. It is updated with a new blog post every Sunday.</p></div></div></div><div class="footerContainer"><div class="contactInfo"><ul><li><img src="/images/githubLogo.png" alt="GitHub"/> <a href="https://github.com/kilkennylj/">kilkennylj</a></li><li><img src="/images/linkedInLogo.png" alt="LinkedIn"/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kilkennylj/">kilkennylj</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"ecrw36aFemKYNTOvV0wBG","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
