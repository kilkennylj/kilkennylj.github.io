It was created based on a shade of purple from one of my dress shirts. Then, I used coolors.co to generate a color palette that looked nice with that color. I made sure the colors had sufficient contrast with each other by using Google Lighthouse, a Google tool that checks contrast on websites along with other things relating to accessibility. After that, I showed the color scheme to many people, asking for their thoughts. After receiving positive reviews, I kept the color scheme that you see now.</p><p>That’s all for today.
