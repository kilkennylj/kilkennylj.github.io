Starting the blog early will be an excellent addition to the website because you can see the past and how development was going."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"I want to talk about hygraph.com, the tool I use to create these blogs. It is very user-friendly and allows you to write what you want while it deals with the styling and format of the blogs. I will change many settings to fit my vision for my website, but it still does a lot of work for me, which is very neat."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"I also want to talk about the color design choices for this website. One of the things I focused on a lot before officially starting on the coding for this site was color. I wanted something that looked unique but also professional. Many personal portfolio websites I view stick to black and white or navy blue. I am not opposed to those colors being on my website, but I feel it’s bland, and I could work harder to find a more excellent color palette that looks professional and unique. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"I succeeded when I found the color scheme that I currently use. It was created based on a shade of purple from one of my dress shirts. Then, I used coolors.co to generate a color palette that looked nice with that color. I made sure the colors had sufficient contrast with each other by using Google Lighthouse, a Google tool that checks contrast on websites along with other things relating to accessibility. After that, I showed the color scheme to many people, asking for their thoughts. After receiving positive reviews, I kept the color scheme that you see now."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"That’s all for today. As the website grows and I encounter more challenges with development, I will talk about them here. Thanks for reading!"}]}]}},"author":{"name":"Liam Kilkenny","biography":null,"id":"clwtmqok20nlv07lnay4kvy09","picture":null},"slug":"post-1","publishedAt":"2024-06-02T15:00:55.092899+00:00","categories":[{"name":"Web Development","slug":"webdev"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"post-1"},"buildId":"FbfpjB0mVCxx8HLh69YN0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
