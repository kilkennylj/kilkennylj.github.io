Today, I will be talking about the game that I am starting development for this summer. I decided to do this because games were a big part of my childhood, so building one as a side project would be fun.

I am using a blender, and I love it so far. When I completed my first model in Blender, an unmade bed, I felt accomplished and excited about my progress. All of the tools are so interesting, and I like how they work together in an intuitive way that doesn’t have me second-guessing how things should work. I am finishing up the dorm room part of my game, which takes place inside a spaceship. </p><p>Now, I want to talk specifically about the space idea that I got. I have loved space and everything about it for a long time. The scope of this game is small, so space is just the setting and a way of giving meaning to the game. I have many ideas on how to do space justice in my game with visuals and some tools in my game engine. I am using Godot, which has been recommended to me by many people who are seriously working on game development. I haven’t done much work with it yet since I will work on the models and ideas of the game first. But I look forward to learning it since it does seem like a fun process.</p><p>That covers how the beginning of this game development is going. I am enjoying the new type of development that goes into game development and modeling with Blender. Right now, the game is still closed source, but to show the work I put in since it is more of a passion project than a money maker, I will make it open source once I feel I should. Thanks for reading!</p></div></div><div class="authorContainer"><h2>Liam Kilkenny</h2><img alt="Liam Kilkenny" class="authorImg" src="https://media.graphassets.com/3jLmcJAIQ8GTMNVwlype"/></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="widgetContainer"><h3>Related Posts</h3></div><div class="widgetContainer"><h3>Categories</h3></div></div></div></div><div class="footerContainer"><div class="contactInfo"><ul><li><img src="/images/githubLogo.png" alt="GitHub"/> <a href="https://github.com/kilkennylj/">kilkennylj</a></li><li><img src="/images/linkedInLogo.png" alt="LinkedIn"/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kilkennylj/">kilkennylj</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Start of My Game Development","excerpt":"I talk about one of my for fun side projects, a space game created using Godot and models from Blender.","content":{"raw":{"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Hey everyone!
