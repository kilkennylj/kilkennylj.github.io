Starting here is very appropriate since this is a problem I encountered on this page. I wanted each blog to become its own page. File-based routing would be the best way to accomplish this goal, but that is a feature of NextJS. However, there is a problem since this project was originally a ReactJS project. So, I had to migrate the site from ReactJS to NextJS. Now, this isn’t an impossible change, but it takes time to ensure everything that did work works on NextJS, and I had to ensure that I followed all of the guidelines that NextJS wants, which can be tricky since it feels like starting over. This problem was daunting at first, but after watching some videos and contacting some web developers I know personally, I made the change, and the site is currently in working order.</p><p>Next, I want to talk about problems that occur during class group projects. Everyone has to deal with group projects in school, and everyone has at least one group project that doesn’t go according to plan. As a computer science major, it is essential to be a great team member, and I found that problems in a group project only helped me grow as a person and learn what to do and what not to do in these situations. One time, specifically in a group project class in my 2nd year at UCF, I struggled to get my teammates to work. This class focused on systems software, focusing less on the groups and more on the final product, which is making a compiler. My team had many problems since one person in our team never did any work, and the other did some work but never tested his code. My solution to this problem was simple. First, I talked to both of them and asked why they struggled to thrive on this team. They told me they were busy with other classes and did not have time to work on this class. I asked them to try to block out their time, a method that works very well for me, and then they could find a time slot for this class. This discussion got one of them to work more and better, but the other still was not working. I had to recognize that sometimes you must reach out to solve your problems, so I went to my professor. </p><p>These stories are essential because reaching out to people who know what to do when you are struggling is very important. People can only solve some of their problems, so why not reach out to people who know what to do? This lesson has stuck with me and has given me great success. I hope you can also recognize this lesson and that it will assist you in reaching your goals.
